[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/bharath0990/Academic-Performance)

A modern, easy-to-use web application designed to help students track and calculate their academic performance. This tool features two primary calculators: a CGPA Calculator and an Attendance Calculator, accessible through a clean, tabbed interface.

## Features

This application provides two essential tools for students:

### ðŸ“Š CGPA Calculator
- **Grade-Based Calculation**: Input the number of subjects for each grade point (from 10 down to 0).
- **Instant Results**: The calculator provides a real-time CGPA calculation based on your inputs.
- **Total Subjects**: Displays the total number of subjects included in the calculation.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily clear all inputs to start a new calculation.

### å‡ºå¸­ Attendance Calculator
- **Customizable Requirements**: Set the required attendance percentage (e.g., 75%, 80%, 85%).
- **Current Status**: Enter the number of classes you've attended and the total number of classes held to see your current attendance percentage.
- **Actionable Insights**:
    - If you are below the required percentage, the calculator tells you exactly how many more classes you need to attend consecutively to meet the requirement.
    - If you are at or above the required percentage, it calculates how many classes you can afford to miss ("bunk") while staying above the threshold.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: The results are presented with clear, color-coded messages to quickly understand your standing.
